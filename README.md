------------------Writing Tests For Mercurial-------------------

The TestAutomation folder contains all the necessary files for creating and running mercurial tests

To create a new test case, simply create a text file titled <testCase##>, replacing the ##'s with the appropriate test case number. This file should be stored inside the testCases folder.

Use the format of testCase_TEMPLATE.txt to format your new file correctly. 
testCase_TEMPLATE.txt is located in the Misc. folder

--------------------------Running Tests--------------------------

To run your tests in terminal, navigate to RedTeam/TestAutomation/scripts

Type "python runAllTests.py"

The results will be output to the console as well as written to an html file (report.html), which can be found in RedTeam/TestAutomation/reports

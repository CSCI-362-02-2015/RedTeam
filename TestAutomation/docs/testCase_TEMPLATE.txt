Below is the format for creating test cases for Mercurial

Information within <>'s should be replaced with information indicated in comments.

Comments (starting with #) should not be written into your test file

NOTE: When writing the component, DO NOT include the .py extension

<ID> 			#The test case number
<Requirement> 		#What this test case should achieve  
<Component> 		#Class whose method is being tested 
<Method> 		#Specific method being tested
<Input(s)> 		#Parameters the method will take
<Expected Outcome> 	#Result the method should return
